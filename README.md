# Snap Pals!
My submission for the [1st Lost Relic Games Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/lost-relic-games-1) (Theme: **Connection**)!

Play as Blue and Pink and work together to defend yourself from the incoming horde of squares!
## Instructions
- Use the **arrow keys** to control Blue.
- Use **WASD** to control Pink.
- By jumping on top of each other, Blue and Pink can snap together and connect to each other. The connection is different based on who's on top!
- Be careful, though: **you can't jump while in a connection!**
- If Blue's on top, he turns into a tank that can **aim with the mouse** and shoot by **holding down the left mouse button**, while Pink moves both of them at once with **WASD**.
- If Pink's on top, she turns Blue into a cannon that can **fire by holding down Space** while Blue moves with the **arrow keys**.
- Shoot squares with cannonballs to defeat them and earn points.
- Rack up a high score, but try not to get hurt and run out of lives!
